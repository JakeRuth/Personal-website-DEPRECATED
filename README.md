Original code for my personal website, which was hosted at www.jakeruth.com from 05/2014 to 11/2016.

I created this as a final project for a UX class I took at school.  I also used it as part of my portfolio and showcase for applying to jobs.

This code is no longer being hosted anywhere as I am recoding the website from scratch to be mobile first and take advantage of the latest technologies available.
