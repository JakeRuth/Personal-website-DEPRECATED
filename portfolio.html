					<div class="project-description">
						When I was interning full time with <a href="http://www.commercehub.com/">CommerceHub</a> during the summer of 2015
						a big project I undertook was creating a Grails plugin.  The plugin is called Grails Shiro Guard, it uses the power of
						the Shiro java application security framework to dynamically add permission strings to a users cache as they navigate 
						through a website.  The plugin is available from the Grails plugin repository for any Grails user to incorporate into their
						own projects.  The plugin is also open sourced and has full documentation, all which can be accessed from the plugin's 
						landing page in Grails (link on photo to the left).

					<div class="project-description">
						I re-coded the game 2048 as an html5 compliant web browser game 	(no flash).  
						I was inspired to re-code the game was because when I played the app version, the animations were too slow and it 
						slowed down my game play.  I used <a href="http://kineticjs.com/" >KineticJS</a>
						(no longer supported unfortunately), and I also did  
						not look at the source code for the original game.  The emotional roller coaster I endured while debugging 
						the game was a learning experience I will not soon forget.  Lastly, I made the tile animation 
						extremely fast (.03 seconds) on purpose, so that the user could play the game as fast as possible, without glitches. 
						Button mash away!

					<div class="project-description">
						MimicMeEmoji is an idea that was inspired by one of my friends.  My friend would take snaps of herself mimicking the faces of emojis
						and overlay the emoji on her face.  I decided to create a web application after tons of my friends raved about how 
						cool and funny they thought the idea was.  On the website you can upload multiple photos of yourself mimicking emojis.  
						To create this I used Grails with mongodb, and amazon s3 for image storage.  
						The response I received from this website was below what I expected, I realized
						that this is way better suited for an app, I have plans to create an app version in the future.

					<div class="project-description">
						During my second semester of my junior year at college I began a private contract with 
						<a href="http://myplasticbrain.com/">My Plastic Brain Inc.</a>.  My job was to program a multitude of html5 compliant
						web games that were catered towards cognitive development.  I made around 30 different games (showcasing one on the right),
						I used KineticJS to power them.  I also frequently communicated with the client over
						the phone to receive and collaborate on requirements for the various games.  I also onboarded 
						and trained a friend to program games for <a href="http://myplasticbrain.com/">My Plastic Brain Inc.</a>.
