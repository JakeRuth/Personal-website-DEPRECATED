						<div class="project-description">
							I re-coded the game 2048 as an html5 compliant web browser game 	(no flash).  
							I was inspired to re-code the game was because when I played the app version, the animations were too slow and it 
							slowed down my game play.  I used <a class="kineticjs-link" href="http://kineticjs.com/" >KineticJS</a>
							(no longer supported unfortunately), and I also did  
							not look at the source code for the original game.  The emotional roller coaster I endured while debugging 
							the game was a learning experience I will not soon forget.  Lastly, I made the tile animation 
							extremely fast (.03 seconds) on purpose, so that the user could play the game as fast as possible, without glitches. 
							Button mash away!
