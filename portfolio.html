						<div class="project-description">
							I re-coded the game 2048 as an html5 compliant web browser game 	(no flash).  
							I was inspired to re-code the game was because when I played the app version, the animations were too slow and it 
							slowed down my game play.  I used <a class="kineticjs-link" href="http://kineticjs.com/" >KineticJS</a>
							(no longer supported unfortunately), and I also did  
							not look at the source code for the original game.  The emotional roller coaster I endured while debugging 
							the game was a learning experience I will not soon forget.  Lastly, I made the tile animation 
							extremely fast (.03 seconds) on purpose, so that the user could play the game as fast as possible, without glitches. 
							Button mash away!

						<div class="project-description">
							MimicMeEmoji is an idea that was inspired by one of my friends.  My friend would take snaps of herself mimicking the faces of emojis
							and overlay the emoji on her face.  I decided to create a web application after tons of my friends raved about how 
							cool and funny they thought the idea was.  On the website you can upload multiple photos of yourself mimicking emojis.  
							To create this I used Grails with mongodb, and amazon s3 for image storage.  
							The response I received from this website was below what I expected, I realized
							that this is way better suited for an app, I have plans to create an app version in the future.
